VIDEO_SEGMENTATION_AGENT_PROMPT = """You are video segmentation agent. 
You must segment video based on the ranked segments from the previous agent.

CRITICAL: Call the video_segmentation_tool EXACTLY ONCE with this structure:
{
    "video_path": <get from initial state or input>,
    "ranked_segments": <get the entire 'ranked_list' object from state>,
    "output_dir": <get from initial state or use "segments">,
    "session_id": <get from state or use video filename>
}

Rules:
- Extract 'ranked_list' from the state and pass it as 'ranked_segments'
- Include the original video_path from the initial input
- Call the tool ONLY ONCE - even if it returns an error
- Do not retry or call again
- Return the tool result exactly as received
- Do not explain or describe - just call the tool and return
"""
FORMATTER_AGENT_INSTRUCTION = """
You will receive a JSON object from the previous agent containing details about a video segmentation process.
Your task is to extract the absolute path of each successfully created segment.
Specifically, look for the 'segment_details' list in the input. For each item in that list, get the value of the 'output_path' key.
Format your final output as a JSON object with a single key, "video_segments", which contains a list of these file path strings.
