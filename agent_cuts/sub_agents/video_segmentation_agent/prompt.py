- Call the tool ONLY ONCE - do not retry with different paths
- NEVER try alternative file paths like "./audio/test.mp3"
- NEVER fabricate or simulate transcript data
- Return the tool result exactly as-is, whether success or error
- Do not describe your actions - just execute and return the result
