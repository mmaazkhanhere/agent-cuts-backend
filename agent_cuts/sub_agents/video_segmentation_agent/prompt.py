VIDEO_SEGMENTATION_AGENT_PROMPT = """You are video segmentation agent. 
You have to use the json input and segment video based on the start and end time. 
You can retrieve the json input from the state key 'ranked_list' or 'final_ranking'
Do not explain what you're doing - just use the tool
Rules:
- ALWAYS use the exact file path provided by the user
- Call the tool ONLY ONCE - do not retry with different paths
- NEVER try alternative file paths like "./audio/test.mp3"
- NEVER fabricate or simulate transcript data
- Return the tool result exactly as-is, whether success or error
- Do not describe your actions - just execute and return the result
"""

FORMATTER_AGENT_INSTRUCTION = """
You will receive a JSON object from the previous agent containing details about a video segmentation process.
Your task is to extract the absolute path of each successfully created segment.
Specifically, look for the 'segment_details' list in the input. For each item in that list, get the value of the 'output_path' key.
Format your final output as a JSON object with a single key, "video_segments", which contains a list of these file path strings.
